# Ray_casting_terminal_prototype
Raycasting proto-game in terminal.


I stumble upon one video on YouTube -> Code-It-Yourself! First Person Shooter (Quick and Simple C++)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw&list=PL36enNxU148RzQ8zwL8FHgg7ef_-5p3cQ

I decided to follow along with the video to check if I can replicate the code, and how Ray casting is working.
This video, was just a spark for my teaching about Raycasting in 3D games from early 90, and how to create one with OpenGL (this will be in future repos).
